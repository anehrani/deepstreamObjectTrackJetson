This repo is to put toghether a production ready fixed camera speed estimation 


>> Project introduction

The goal of this project is to calculate the speed of cars from given video frames teken from a fixed camera

 1- webservise to parse the json and get the required data 
 2- algorithm to detect the target car and collect frames
 3. algorithm to calculate speed from the collected frames



>> Requirements:




>> Working specification






>> functionality
